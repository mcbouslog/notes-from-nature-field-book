# Notes from Nature Field Book

The Notes from Nature Field Book is intended to provide a dashboard for volunteers that participate in [Notes from Nature](https://www.notesfromnature.org).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs the dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

## Notes

Accepts query params `env=production` or `project_id=1234` (1234 = desired project ID).
